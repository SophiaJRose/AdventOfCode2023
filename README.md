My solutions for Advent of Code 2023. Initally solving each problem in Ruby, then reimplementing solution in Go.

Unsolved problems:
* Day 12 Part 2 - Solution for part 1 is too inefficient to solve in a reasonable time
* Day 17 - Attempted solution is both incorrect on example, and quickly reaches "stack level too deep" error on actual input, may come back to later
* Day 24 Part 2 - Have not yet figured out a solution, may come back to later
